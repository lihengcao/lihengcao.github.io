    <h1>Motivation for this</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>People don't remember/retain what they read.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If they do remember, they don't apply it. </li>
            <li>Writing here will force me to summarize what each book is about.</li>
            <li>I will worry about application at a later time...</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Trying to get "back into" reading. Learning in public and all that!</li>
        <li>(At the time of writing) I finished a book recently, but it took me quite a long time to recall even the name of the book.</li>
    </ul>
