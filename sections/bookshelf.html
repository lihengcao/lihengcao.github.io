    <ul>
        <li>Usually, people don't remember/retain what they read. If they do, they don't apply it.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Writing here will force me to summarize what each book is about.</li>
            <li>I'm not sure what to do about applying the learning. I will worry about application at a later time...</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Trying to get "back into" reading. Step 1. Learning in public. Step 2. ??? Step 3. Profit!</li>
        <li>(At the time of writing) I finished a book recently, but it took me quite a long time to recall even the name of the book.</li>
        <li>For the articles section, it also as an extended bookmarks menu.</li>
    </ul>

    Since this is the internet, I'll also add non-book but reading/adjacent content here as well.

                <ul><li>but this can apply to other things that aren't traumatic but are still stressfull</li></ul>
                <li>The direct reason(s) for this effect aren't clear, but some possibilities are:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Writing it down brings closure, which can make you focus on other things better</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Better focus on other events, such as work and relationships</li>
                        <li>Better sleep (kind of related to the last one)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Writing also makes you re-analyze those memories, potentially bringing new insights</li>

                    <li>This was only brought up at the end of the book, interestingly</li>
                    <li>In short, if you've already forgot about an event, then writing about it may cause you to re-remember, which may be bad in this context</li>
