          Usually, what is read isn't remembered/retained. Even if it is, the
          next step isn't taken and it's not applied.

            Writing here will force me to summarize what each book is about.
          </li>
          <li>
            I'm not sure what to do about applying the learning. I will worry
            about application at a later time...

          (At the time of writing) I finished a book recently, but it took me
          quite a long time to recall even the name of the book.

            TLDR: A timeline overview of Huawei. Talks *a lot* about hard work
            and the grind. One interesting tidbit were the "voluntary
            resignations" (not really voluntary) where employees were told to
            write their own resignation letters if they felt like they could not
            "grind" for the company anymore.

                    Language allows better coordination across long distances.
                    Interesting example is that colonists could write home and
                    end up encouraging/inspiring more people to come
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Political organization allows for better combat organization
                    and administration of new land. An interesting example of
                    this was "being proud to die for your country."

                How did Europeans (and Asians in general, as evidenced by
                expansion in Austronesian) acquire these advantages?
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Larger landmass and population of Eurasia lead to more chances
                  for things to develop One big example is agriculture and
                  animal husbandry.
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Places like the Americas and Africa didn't have that much
                    "starting" plant and animals that could be domesticated.
                    Even in modern times with the efforts of modern day science,
                    many haven't been domesticated. (Proof* that they weren't
                    easily domesticated)
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  Agriculture then leads to population, which leads to disease
                  and general technology.
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Lots of disease developed from domesticated animals being in
                    close proximity to humans. Interesting example is certain
                    seasonal diseases that could only survive in large enough
                    populations without killing everyone.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  The same applies to technology. Not much elaboration necessary
                  here.
                </li>
                <li>East west vs north south axis</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Moving east west keeps the same climate, so spreading
                    agriculture is easier (and by extension, civilization)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Places like sub Saharan Africa and the America's have a
                    north south axis. The climate changes, which makes it hard
                    to spread crops because you couldn't gradually expand inch
                    by inch; instead, it would need to be a major relocation.

                <li>
                  then writing about traumatic events can be good for your

              <ul>
                <li>
                  but this can apply to other things that aren't traumatic but
                  are still stressfull
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>
                The direct reason(s) for this effect aren't clear, but some
                possibilities are:
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Writing it down brings closure, which can make you focus on
                  other things better
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Better focus on other events, such as work and relationships
                  </li>
                  <li>Better sleep (kind of related to the last one)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  Writing also makes you re-analyze those memories, potentially
                  bringing new insights
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>However, it's not always beneficial</li>

                  In short, if you've already forgot about an event, then
                  writing about it may cause you to re-remember, which may be
                  bad in this context
