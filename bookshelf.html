        <li>Usually, people don't remember/retain what they read. If they do, they don't apply it.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Writing here will force me to summarize what each book is about.</li>
            <li>I will worry about application at a later time...</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Trying to get "back into" reading. Step 1. Learning in public. Step 2. ??? Step 3. Profit!</li>
        <li>(At the time of writing) I finished a book recently, but it took me quite a long time to recall even the name of the book.</li>
        <li>For the articles section, it also as an extended bookmarks menu.</li>
    </ul>

    Since this is the internet, I'll also add non-book but reading/adjacent content here as well.
